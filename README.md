# Hand-Sign-Classification (0-5)
- Implemented helper functions that you will use when implementing a TensorFlow model
- Implemented a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow
- Built and trained a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem

Using the brand new SIGNS dataset, we will build a basic convolutional neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy (100% on Train set and 90% on Dev set).
