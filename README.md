# Hand-Sign-Classification-0-5
- Implemented helper functions that you will use when implementing a TensorFlow model
- Implemented a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow
- Built and trained a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem

Using the brand new SIGNS dataset, we will build a basic convolutional neural network model to recognize numbers from 0 to 5 in sign language with a pretty impressive accuracy (90% on Test-set).
